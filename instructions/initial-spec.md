# MCP Server for Rust Documentation Lookup

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server will be a Rust-based application that enables lookup and retrieval of Rust documentation from docs.rs. It will expose documentation elementsâ€”such as Traits, Structs, Enums, etc. - as Resources over the MCP protocol. The server will operate in two modes: one using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming and another using a stdio interface for command-line interactions.

## Objectives

- **Documentation Retrieval:** Scrape docs.rs webpages to extract and index Rust documentation.
- **Resource Exposure:** Represent docs.rs elements (Traits, Structs, Enums, etc.) as structured Resources.
- **Protocol Modes:** Support both SSE for streaming responses and stdio for command-line usage.
- **Robustness:** Handle errors gracefully and implement caching and concurrency best practices.
- **Extensibility:** Design the system to allow easy integration of additional documentation sources in the future.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Scraper Module**
   - **Purpose:** Fetch and parse HTML content from docs.rs.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Retrieve webpages using an HTTP client.
     - Parse HTML content using an HTML parsing library.
     - Extract documentation elements including Traits, Structs, Enums, etc.
     - Validate page structure and handle changes in the docs.rs layout.
     - Cache extracted data to reduce repeated network calls.

2. **Resource Model**
   - **Data Structure:** Define a Resource struct that includes:
     - `name`: The name of the resource.
     - `kind`: The type of resource (Trait, Struct, Enum, etc.).
     - `url`: The source URL on docs.rs.
     - `description`: A brief description or summary.
     - Additional metadata as needed.

3. **MCP Server Module**
   - **Purpose:** Provide an interface to query the scraped documentation.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Serve HTTP endpoints supporting SSE for streaming updates.
     - Support stdio operations for command-line usage.
     - Handle incoming queries and return matching Resources.
     - Manage concurrent requests using an asynchronous runtime (e.g., Tokio).

4. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - **Approach:**
     - Use robust error handling strategies with guard clauses.
     - Log errors and events using a structured logging framework.
     - Provide meaningful error messages for both scraping and serving processes.

## Protocol Details

### MCP Resource Format

- **Resource JSON Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "ExampleResource",
    "kind": "Struct",
    "url": "https://docs.rs/example/1.0.0/example/struct.ExampleResource.html",
    "description": "An example struct for demonstration purposes."
  }
  ```

### Query and Response Flow

1. **Request Handling:**
   - The server accepts a query to look up documentation (e.g., by resource name or type).
   - Validate and sanitize query inputs at the entry point.

2. **Processing:**
   - Use a guard clause pattern to check for error conditions (e.g., invalid input, network failures).
   - Scrape and retrieve the relevant documentation if not available in the cache.
   - Convert the extracted documentation into a structured Resource.

3. **Response:**
   - **SSE Mode:**
     - Stream results as SSE events with appropriate MIME type (`text/event-stream`).
     - Each event contains a serialized Resource.
   - **Stdio Mode:**
     - Output the result to STDOUT in a human-readable or JSON format suitable for piping.

## Implementation Considerations

### Concurrency & Asynchronous Operations

- Use the Tokio runtime to support asynchronous HTTP requests and concurrent handling of multiple client connections.
- Ensure thread safety and proper resource management during scraping and serving.

### Caching Strategy

- Implement a caching mechanism to store previously scraped documentation.
- Define cache invalidation policies to keep data up to date with docs.rs changes.

### Error Handling

- Adopt guard clause patterns to handle errors first, avoiding nested conditionals.
- Ensure that both scraping failures and query processing errors are handled gracefully.
- Provide fallback responses or error messages when resources cannot be retrieved.

### Security

- Validate and sanitize all incoming queries to avoid injection attacks or other malicious inputs.
- Implement rate limiting and other controls if needed to prevent abuse.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests:** Validate functionality of individual modules (scraper, resource parser, MCP endpoints).
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate end-to-end flows including HTTP requests (SSE mode) and stdio interactions.
- **Error Simulation:** Include tests for network failures, malformed HTML, and other edge cases.

## Third-Party Libraries

- **HTTP Client:** Use [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
- **HTML Parsing:** Use [scraper](https://crates.io/crates/scraper) or a similar library to parse HTML content.
- **Asynchronous Runtime:** Use [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) for async processing.
- **Logging:** Use a logging framework such as [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) for structured logging.

## Deployment

- Build the server as a standalone binary targeting Linux systems.
- Provide configuration options (e.g., cache settings, port numbers, etc.) via environment variables or a configuration file.
- Ensure proper monitoring and logging to facilitate debugging and operational oversight.

## Future Enhancements

- Extend scraping capabilities to support additional documentation sources.
- Develop a web-based UI for interactive documentation lookup.
- Introduce a more advanced query language for complex search queries across multiple resources.

This specification serves as the context for building an MCP server in Rust to facilitate efficient lookup of Rust documentation from docs.rs.
